        <p>My name is Sandra Grahl and I'm in the process of learning how to code. I'm originally from Sweden, but I've lived
          in London since 2015. People would describe me as a storyteller, I enjoy writing books and reading books, but also
          digital communication. </p>

          <i class="material-icons md 35">info</i> PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE</h2>
        <p>I have experience working with layout and design from when I had my own webshop during 2014-2015, and from making posters for a number of different clients such as the theatre, DJ's and political organisations.
          Other than that, I've dabbled a bit with CSS and HTML during most of my life on and off, mostly tinkering with
          webpages in the blog format. I've also used Udacity to teach myself more about coding with the courses "Intro to
          HTML and CSS" and "Web Development".</p>

          <i class="material-icons md 35">add_circle</i> EXTRAS</h2>
        <p>I am fairly confident when it comes to handling social media accounts. I enjoy photography and photo editing and
          I'm used to programs such as Photoshop. Ambitious and driven, I always have a side project or two
          in order to appease my creative side. The goal is to be able to use coding to create even more exciting side projects,
          as well as getting a job as a front end developer.
